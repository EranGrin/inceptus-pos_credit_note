# inceptus-pos_credit_note
A credit note is a paper note issued by a retailer to a customer when goods are returned. A credit note acts like a Voucher / Gift Card that can only be used in the particular shop or chain of shops that issued the credit note. If customer returning goods to the shop the retailer can refund the customer with a credit note instead of money refund, in that way customer is bound to redeem the credit note in the shop or other chain shops of the company.
Product Exchange: In case that a customer wants to exchange the bought product the “POS Credit Note” module give a very convincing solution. 
The retailer refund the customer with a credit note, the customer can find his new desire product and use the credit note to purchase the new product, if the new product is more expensive than the refund credit then user can easily add the rest amount with another payment method, and if the new product is less expensive than the refund credit, than not all the amount will be charged from the credit note and user can use the amount in another occasion
